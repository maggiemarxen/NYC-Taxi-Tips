# NYC-Taxi-Tips

Abstract
-
NYC TaxiTips uses past data to optimize your transit between boroughs. To use, enter the promoted information about your upcoming trip and we will provide you with tips to save time and money, and show you your estimated savings based on averages. 


Design process
-
I began my design thinking about the features that would ease my own transit, putting myself into the mindset of a NYC traveler, while keeping in mind the given API data. My list is as follows:
-based on a preference of saving either time or money or both, if yellow, green, or for hire is best
-tips to save money, ex avoiding extra charges
-tips to save time, ex traveling later or earlier
-tradeoffs of saving time/money, with lower tolls
-success rates of negotiated fares & their average savings
After weighing these features, I decided to pursue consumer research to think of additional features as well as rank their priorities. 


Market research
-
One of my friends recently started a full time job in NYC, so I asked her to participate in a quick user research study. Over FaceTime video call, I asked her to think of one recent instance where she used a taxi or rideshare in NYC. On my screen, I showed my MVP paper webpage and filled in her corresponding starting and ending boroughs. I then asked what tips would have been useful for her, telling her they can include details about ride start time, end time, tolls, rush hour charges, overnight charges, etc.

She described an overnight ride share trip between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Her advice changed my perspective greatly. I had been thinking of mostly money saving-related tools, but she stressed the annoyance of traffic in NYC and said that saving a few dollars is never worth the hassle of additional traffic, to her. She would generally use the subway in cases where time is less of a concern, as she uses taxis/ride shares when she needs to arrive somewhere by a deadline, such as to the airport or an appointment.

After listening to her ideas, I then shared my ideas. We discussed and ranked our ideas, combined, to create a priority-rated feature list.

Solution
-
I decided to create a GitHub webpage to display money-saving tips based on starting and ending boroughs. I decided this because a webpage is easy for a customer such as my research candidate to use. I have created one GitHub webpage in the past, so this was relatively, but not completely, new.

Project limitations
-
One limitation was the data available. There was not too much information available for for-hire, including even prices, so my comparisons do not adequately cover all facets of every option. Another limitation is in my market research. My research that helped to dictate my priorities only covered one riderâ€™s experience on one ride in particular, which is clearly not representative of all taxi and for-hire rides in NYC. If I had more time, I would interview a variety of people about rides at different types of each day, using different methods.
